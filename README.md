# COMP6441-Keylogger
For my something awesome project for COMP6441, I decided to have a practical and theorical project surrounding around the topic of keyloggers. Keyloggers are viruses or monitoring software used to record user keystrokes along with other features such as taking screenshots depending on how the keylogger has been implemented. For my practical component, I have built an advanced keylogger and a corresponding anti-virus for it in Python. For my theoretical component, I have decided to research all about keyloggers including what it is, how does it work, what some of its application are and how people can protect themselves from keyloggers. This can include ways such as removing the keylogger or prevention methods to stop the activity of keyloggers. This was written on a Google document in the form of a Q&A guide.
